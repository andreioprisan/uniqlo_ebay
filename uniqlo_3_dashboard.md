The Uniqlo eBay Dashboard displays a variety of numbers, graphs, and tables on the sold shirt listings from 5/2020 to 7/2020. Here is a brief description of its specific features and findings pertaining to the entire duration available:
* To the right of the title, there exists a date slider. This may be manually adjusted so that the numbers, graphs, and tables on the dashboard represent the listings data within the time frame.


* Beneath the title and slider, there are a couple of calculations: total number of shirts sold, the net average order value using the median (net AOV), percent of total shirts that were KAWS, and percent of total shirts that were auction items.


* In the upper-left corner, there is a scatterplot over time of net AOV of KAWS and non-KAWS Uniqlo shirt orders. It appears that for almost any given date within the time frame, the net AOV for a KAWS order is higher than that of a non-KAWS Uniqlo order. There does not appear to be a temporal dependence for net AOV on day.


* In the upper-right corner, there is a heat map table containing major retail regions (seller's location) as well as the net AOV for non-KAWS and KAWS orders. Among these regions, it is apparent that the KAWS orders have a higher net AOV compared to the non-KAWS Uniqlo ones. Nevertheless, it is interesting to point out that the net AOV for non-KAWS Uniqlo shirts for international sellers is considerably higher than those for regions within the States. 


* In the lower-left corner, there is a scatterplot of net AOV vs. character count in listing title; each point represents a particular day. From a cursory glance, it appears that there exist a considerable number of KAWS listings with fewer characters in the title than those of non-KAWS Uniqlo listings.


* In the lower-middle corner, there is a heat map table containing median measures for auction-only Uniqlo shirt listings (number of bids, number of reviews left of the seller, and net AOV). It seems that KAWS listings have a slightly higher number of bids as well as a fair number of ratings more than those of non-KAWS.


* In the lower-right corner, there is a heat map table of net AOV by purchase type and condition type. A relative comparison of net AOV values confirm that better condition items are sold for higher prices. However, what is intriguing is that it appears that listings sold on an offered price point by the consumer have a higher net AOV than those sold on a fixed price point by the seller.  

It is important to note that different time frames set by the sliding filter may alter the results presented above. Nevertheless, it appears that overall speaking, KAWS listings sell at higher price points (net AOV) and spark slightly more interest among consumers (number of bids) than non-KAWS listings. While KAWS shirts made up of only ~26% of the 4,500 sold Uniqlo shirt listings over the summer, it is apparent that they are very much in-demand and are considered quite valuable to purchase.
