The Uniqlo eBay Dashboard displays a variety of numbers, graphs, and tables on the sold shirt listings from 5/2020 to 7/2020. Here is a brief description of its specific features and findings pertaining to the entire duration available:
* To the right of the title, there exists a date slider. This may be manually adjusted so that the numbers, graphs, and tables on the dashboard represent the listings data within the time frame.


* Beneath the title and slider, there are a couple of calculations: total number of shirts sold, the net average order value, percent of total shirts that were KAWS, and percent of total sales that were KAWS.


* In the upper-left corner, there is a scatterplot over time of net AOV of KAWS and non-KAWS Uniqlo shirt orders. It appears that for almost any given date within the time frame, the net AOV for a KAWS order is higher than that of a non-KAWS Uniqlo order. There does not appear to be a temporal dependence for net AOV on day.


* In the upper-right corner, there is a heat map table containing major retail regions (seller's location) as well as the net AOV by shirt type (non-KAWS and KAWS orders). Comparing across regions, it is apparent that the KAWS orders have a higher net AOV compared to non-KAWS Uniqlo ones. Nevertheless, it is interesting to point out that the net AOV for non-KAWS Uniqlo shirts for international sellers is considerably higher than those for regions within the States. 


* In the lower-left corner, there is a pie chart for total sales broken down by shirt type. Within the time period, although KAWS orders only made up of ~25% of the orders, they made up ~40% of the total sales. 


* In the lower-middle and lower-right corner, there is a heat map table of net AOV by purchase type and condition type for KAWS and non-KAWS shirts. Regardless of purchase type, the AOVs for pre-owned KAWS shirts are higher than that of new non-KAWS ones: the notion that people seem to be willing to pay more for already worn items in the collection compared to typical new items demonstrates the brand power of KAWS.

It is important to note that different time frames set by the sliding filter may alter the results presented above. Nevertheless, it appears that these relatively higher prices of KAWS items compared to non-KAWS ones across different categories like region, condition, and purchase type serve as a testament to the power in KAWS branding.
